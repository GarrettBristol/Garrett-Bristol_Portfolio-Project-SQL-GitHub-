# Garrett Bristol Portfolio Project Exploring SQL GitHub 
My First Project, showing my application of new skills, I gained in SQL
---
In this project, I began by exploring a site called HackerRank. HackerRank offers coding challenges in algorithms, data structures, AI, and databases to help users improve their computer specific problem-solving skills. It provides certifications in many fields like Python, Java, and the emphasis of this project SQL. The platform incorporates a game structure, rewarding users with badges, points, and ranks. This mix of challenges, certifications, and a progressive reward system makes HackerRank a valuable tool for learning and career growth.
